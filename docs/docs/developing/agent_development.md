# Agent Development

## Overview

This document describes the steps involved in onboarding a new NPU to the FBOSS agent using OSS.

## Steps

1. **Build SDK and SAI SDK**
    1. Currently, FBOSS agent supports different NPU vendors like Broadcom.
    2. Broadcom SDK example:
        - [ ] FBOSS agent code needs both SAI SDK and native Broadcom SDK to function. For a new NPU, certain Broadcom SDK and SAI SDK versions are required. Please contact Broadcom for the proper release version. As mentioned in [FBOSS build documentation](https://facebook.github.io/fboss/docs/build/building_fboss_on_docker_containers/), static linked libraries from SAI SDK and Broadcom native SDK are necessary to build FBOSS agent binaries.

2. **Add New ASIC to FBOSS Agent**
    1. [Optional depending on whether ASIC is already supported]
    2. Current FBOSS supports TH, TH2, TH3, TH4, TH5, TH6 ASIC.
    3. ASIC behavior lives in the ASIC traits (`HwAsic` subclasses under [fboss/agent/hw/switch_asics/](https://github.com/facebook/fboss/tree/main/fboss/agent/hw/switch_asics)). Values that used to be defined per platform — such as `numLanesPerCore()`, `numCellsAvailable()`, the SAI physical lane IDs, and internal system-port config — now live on the ASIC trait. When onboarding a new ASIC, add or extend these methods on the ASIC class so platforms using it need no ASIC-specific C++.

3. **Add New Platform Support to FBOSS Agent**
    1. The platform mapping controls how many ports are enabled, port speed, and logical port and physical port mapping. This mapping is highly dependent on hardware design. Please refer to [Platform Mapping Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/fboss/docs/developing/platform_mapping/) for more details. The platform mapping generates two files: a JSON file, which should be copied to FBOSS agent code, and a YAML file used in Broadcom SDK initialization.
    2. FBOSS agent also needs to know the platform name and the platform type to select the right platform mapping and other platform-specific files.
    3. FBOSS supports a **config-driven platform model**: for a standard platform, generate a platform mapping plus a platform descriptor and run with `--platform_descriptor_config_path`, so the agent instantiates generic platform/port classes (`GenericSaiBcmPlatform` / `GenericSaiTajoPlatform`) with no per-platform C++. Platforms with custom behavior can still add dedicated classes. Please refer to the "Config-Driven Platform Support" and "Manual Path" sections in [FBOSS New Platform Support](https://facebook.github.io/fboss/docs/developing/new_platform_support/).
