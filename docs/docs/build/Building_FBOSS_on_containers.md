This document covers how to build FBOSS binaries and all its library
dependencies on Docker containers.

## Clone the FBOSS Repository
We will be working out of the root of the repository:

```bash file=./static/code_snips/clone_fboss.sh
```

## Set Up the FBOSS Container

### Stop Existing Containers and Clean Docker Artifacts

This isn't a strictly required step, although in some cases you may want to
build a completely fresh container to use. The below commands will stop any
existing Docker containers and clean the image cache so that the subsequent
steps will build the container from scratch:

```bash file=./static/code_snips/clean_docker.sh
```

### Build the FBOSS Docker Image

The FBOSS GitHub repository contains a Dockerfile that can be used to create
the Docker container image for building FBOSS binaries. The Dockerfile is
located under `fboss/oss/docker/Dockerfile`. Use the below command to
build the image, which installs required dependencies. Note that the path
to the Dockerfile is relative, so the below commands assume you are currently running
them from the root of the repository:

```bash file=./static/code_snips/build_docker_image.sh
```

## Start the FBOSS Container

### Start a Container for Platform Stack

```bash file=./static/code_snips/start_platform_stack_container.sh
```

### Start a Container for Forwarding Stack

```bash file=./static/code_snips/start_forwarding_stack_container.sh
```

### Enter the Container

```bash file=./static/code_snips/enter_docker_container.sh
```

At this point, you should be dropped into a root shell within the Docker container
and can proceed with the next steps to start the build.

## Build FBOSS Binaries

Instructions for building FBOSS binaries may have slight differences based on
which SDK you are linking against.

### Build Platform Stack

You only need one command to build the Platform Stack, where `$TARGET` is
`fboss_platform_services`:

```bash file=./static/code_snips/build_with_cmake_target.sh
```

### Build Forwarding Stack

This section assumes that you have a precompiled SDK library which you want to
link against. More specifically, you'll need the static library `libsai_impl.a`
for the SDK which you are trying to link against, as well as the associated set
of SAI headers. In order to run the build:

#### Run the Build Helper

```bash file=./static/code_snips/build_helper.sh
```

#### Set Important Environment Variables

```bash file=./static/code_snips/important_environment_variables.sh
```

#### Build Against the SDK

Ensure you are in the right directory, set your relevant environment variables,
and start the build:

```bash file=./static/code_snips/build_forwarding_stack.sh
```

### Limit the Build to a Specific Target

You can limit the build to a specific target by using the `--cmake-target` flag.
Buildable targets can be found by examining the cmake scripts in the repository.
Any buildable target will be specified in the cmake scripts either by
`add_executable` or `add_library`. Example command below:

```bash file=./static/code_snips/build_with_cmake_target.sh
```
