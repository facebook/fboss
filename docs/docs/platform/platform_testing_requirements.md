# FBOSS Platform Testing Requirements

## Introduction

This FBOSS platform  testing requirement is a minimal set of requirements that
vendors must perform before every software and hardware release. Vendors are
responsible for adding additional tests needed based on the platform design
and features, to ensure  units shipped to Meta are ready for Meta internal
platform development.

## x86

### One month before shipping the Unit to Meta

* Represent the Platform with PlatformManager configuration and ensure it passes validation.

### Before every software/hardware release, run the following tests

#### Software Tests

* Run all the tests in the fboss/platform directory. These tests can be run on any host. They are important if there are code changes to the fboss/platform directory (in addition to configuration changes). Note: These tests will also run on github when the vendor raises a PR.

  Test cases can be found in this file, in “fboss_platform_services”,  any tests does not end with “_hw_test” : [https://github.com/facebook/fboss/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L1002](https://github.com/facebook/fboss/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L1002)

#### Hardware Tests

* These tests need to run on the actual HW platform. Note: These tests will not run on github PRs. Test cases can be found in this file, in “fboss_platform_services”, end with “_hw_test” : [https://github.com/facebook/fboss/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L1002](https://github.com/facebook/fboss/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L1002)

  * platform_manager_hw_test

  * sensor_service_hw_test

  * fan_service_hw_test

  * data_corral_service_hw_test

  * weutil_hw_test

  * fw_util_hw_test

## Firmware {#firmware}

As we do not have an open-source firmware test repository to share with vendors
, we expect them to perform the basic tests outlined below by writing their own
 scripts. Some of these tests will be manual in nature. This represents the
 minimum firmware testing qualification that Meta expects vendors to meet
 before delivering firmware binaries.

####

| Basic  Tests | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| Firmware Upgrade | Upgrade to the new binary |
| Firmware Downgrade | Revert back to previous Binary |
| Power Cycle | Power cycle in between test to make sure the Box comes back after upgrade & Downgrade |
| BMC OOB Reachability | Verify that the OOB is ssh’able after upgrade |
| x86 Reachability | Veriffy X86 is ssh’able after upgrade |
| ASIC Detection | Verify that ASIC can be detected on the PCI bus after upgrade |
| Memory & CPU Consumption | Verify the Memory & CPU consumption is within acceptable threshold after FW Upgrade |
| LED & Display Testing | Check all LEDs, display, or indicators functions as expected (Blinking patterns, color changes) |
| Buttons | Test all buttons (push button, switch buttons), if any, to ensure they respond correctly and consistently |
| FW version Readout | Verify that version can be read after upgrade & downgrade and it meets the expected version |
| BIOS & CPU_CPLD Back up path | Test BIOS & CPU_CPLD OpenBMC Back-up path FW upgrade works as expected |
