# Meta Network Hardware Switch Requirements v1.0

This document captures the unified hardware requirements for network switches to be seamlessly integrated into Meta's data center infrastructure.

Note: These requirements are complementary to the [Meta Switch Architecture](https://facebook.github.io/fboss/docs/architecture/meta_switch_architecture) (a.k.a. BMC Lite Requirements), which covers internal switch hardware and software design. This RFC focuses on how the switch integrates into Meta's data center infrastructure.


#### **Versioning:**

* This document will have source-control-based versioning and tracking for all changes.
* This document has a major revision number, which will be updated for major changes.
* This document has a minor revision number, which will be updated for any change in specification which will necessitate a hardware or software change in the switch.


## **1. Power**

### **1.1 Power Delivery Architecture**

Meta data centers use the ORv3 (Open Rack V3) rack and power system. In this architecture, rack-mounted PSU shelves take 3-phase AC input from tap boxes via whip cables and convert it to 48V DC, which is distributed to IT gear through a vertical busbar. BBU (Battery Backup Unit) shelves provide backup power during AC outages — they do not actively load-share during normal operation. No PDU is required for ORv3; whip cables connect directly to the PSU shelf.

Network switches receive power in two ways depending on form factor:

- Pizza-box switches (e.g., Rack Switches) are PSU-type agnostic. They can use either an AC PSU (with AC power cords, for standalone/EIA-19" deployment) or a DC/DC PSU (powered from the 48V busbar in ORv3/ORv3N racks). AC and DC PSUs are not mixed in the same deployment.

- Blade switches (e.g., Scale Up Blades) have no PSU, and they are powered by the 48V rack busbar.

- The ORv3 ecosystem includes several rack variants (see table below).

| Rack Variant | Power (Max/Roofline) | PSU/BBU Configuration | Busbar & Physical Specs | Primary Use/Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| ORv3N | ~28KW | Varies PSU shelves, 6x 3KW modules, 3KW BBU | Used for AI/HPC: Includes PMM for shelf-level monitoring. | Network-dedicated racks for DCTypeX MDF and DCTypeF server rows. |
