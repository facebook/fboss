    The binary reads its platform/LED config from /etc/coop/led.conf (the same
    file led_service uses on the DUT), so no --config or --qsfp-config is
    passed. led_service must stay running while the test runs, so it is
    deliberately omitted from TEST_DISABLE_SERVICES. The
    test's hardware readback path (LedManager::getLedStateFromHW, exercised by
    testTcvrLos' slow-blink LOS checks) depends on led_service having
    initialized the LED controllers. Stopping led_service tears that down and
    makes the physical readback fail even though the in-process color/blink
    logic is correct. LED tests do not warmboot.
