"""Per-run log capture for the FBOSS OSS test runner.

Opt-in via the global ``--log-bundle`` flag. When enabled, it collects
everything from a single ``run_test`` invocation into one per-run directory
under ``/opt/fboss/logs/run_test/`` so it is easy to inspect and transfer:

- ``command.txt``  -- the exact CLI invocation + environment.
- ``run_test.log`` -- a tee of this process's stdout+stderr (the runner's own
  output, the gtest stdout it echoes, and the inherited stderr/glog of the test
  binaries it spawns), written to both the terminal and the file.
- service logs and result CSVs, routed into the same directory by their owners.

At the end of the run the directory is zipped into a sibling ``.zip`` for easy
copy off the switch.
