# bash completion for the fboss2 / fboss2-dev CLIs (OSS).
#
# The binaries expose their compiled-in command tree via the hidden
# `__completion` subcommand: given the words typed so far (the last one being
# the word under the cursor), they print the candidate completions one per
# line: sub-commands, options, and the leaf attribute tokens of commands that
# implement completeArgs (see fboss/cli/fboss2/utils/ArgCompletion.h). Because
# the answer comes from the binary itself, completion never goes stale as
# commands are added.
#
# Needs only bash builtins; the bash-completion package is optional.
# Install: source it from your shell rc, or copy it to /etc/bash_completion.d/.
