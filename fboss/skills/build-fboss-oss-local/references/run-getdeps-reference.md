# `run-getdeps.py` reference

`fboss/oss/scripts/run-getdeps.py` is the FBOSS wrapper around
`build/fbcode_builder/getdeps.py`. Always go through it rather than calling
getdeps directly for a build: several things CMake requires are set up only
here.

Run `./fboss/oss/scripts/run-getdeps.py -h` for the live flag list and
`--getdeps-help` for getdeps' own. The tables below explain what the flags
*mean*; the script is authoritative on what exists.

## Command shape

```text
./fboss/oss/scripts/run-getdeps.py <wrapper flags> <getdeps subcommand> <getdeps flags> fboss
```

The wrapper parses its own flags, then forwards **everything from the
subcommand onward** to getdeps verbatim. Put wrapper flags first or they are
silently passed through to getdeps, which will reject them.

## Wrapper flags

### NPU (switch ASIC) SAI SDK

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--npu-sai-impl <TOKEN>` | Which implementation. Supported tokens: see `-h` and the `CMakeLists.txt` `if/elseif` chain. Exported as `<TOKEN>=1`. |
| `--npu-sai-sdk-version <SELECTOR>` | **Required** whenever `--npu-sai-impl` is given. e.g. `SAI_VERSION_14_2_0_0_ODP`. Becomes a bare `-D<SELECTOR>` compile define. |
| `--npu-sai-version <X.Y.Z>` | OCP SAI **spec** version to download. Hard-validated against a built-in table of pinned checksums. |
| `--npu-libsai-impl-path <DIR>` | Directory *containing* `libsai_impl.a`. Not the `.a` file itself. |
| `--npu-experiments-path <DIR>` | Directory containing the vendor's flat SAI extension headers. |
| `--npu-libsai-impl-tarball <FILE>` | Alternative to the two path flags: a tarball the wrapper extracts and stages. |

`--npu-libsai-impl-path` and `--npu-experiments-path` must be given
**together**. `--npu-libsai-impl-tarball` is mutually exclusive with both.

### PHY / PAI SDK

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--phy-sai-impl <TOKEN>` | Officially supported: `SAI_BRCM_PAI_IMPL`. |
| `--phy-sai-version <X.Y.Z>` | OCP SAI spec version for the PHY pass. May differ from the NPU one. |
| `--phy-pai-sdk-path <DIR>` | Unpacked PAI SDK; must contain `lib/{libepdm.a,libpai.a,libphymodepil.a}` and `include/{sai,pai_macsec,epdm}`. |
| `--phy-pai-sdk-tarball <FILE>` | Same, as a tarball. Mutually exclusive with `--phy-pai-sdk-path`. |

The three `--phy-*` detail flags are **silently ignored** (warning only) if
`--phy-sai-impl` is not set.

### Everything else

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--benchmark-install` | Sets `BENCHMARK_INSTALL=1`. Without it, benchmark binaries are not built or installed. |
| `--skip-install` | Sets `SKIP_ALL_INSTALL=1`; build without running install rules. |
| `--preserve-env` | Leave already-set environment variables alone. Default is the opposite: flags win over pre-existing environment. |
| `--use-gcc` | Stay on GCC. Default is to force Clang. |
| `--getdeps-help` | Short-circuits everything and prints getdeps' help. |

The wrapper's `--asan` flag is disabled in source pending ASAN support. CMake
still honours a `WITH_ASAN` environment variable, but nothing exercises that
path, so treat an ASAN build as unsupported until you have verified it.

## Commonly used getdeps flags (passed through)

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--scratch-path <DIR>` | Where all output goes. Always pass it explicitly. |
| `--src-dir <DIR>` | Build this tree rather than a pinned clone. See [getdeps-concepts.md](getdeps-concepts.md#pinning). |
| `--cmake-target <T>` | Build one aggregate target. Repeatable. Default is `install`. |
| `--allow-system-packages` | Satisfy dependencies from installed packages. Effectively required. |
| `--build-type <T>` | `Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo` (default), `MinSizeRel`, `Release`. |
| `--num-jobs <N>` | Parallelism. Omit by default: getdeps sizes it from available RAM. Pass it only to go lower when an out-of-memory failure coincides with genuinely low free memory; see [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md). |
| `--only-deps` / `--no-deps` | Split the dependency phase from the project phase. |
| `--extra-cmake-defines '<json>'` | Extra `-D` values. The **exact string** feeds the rebuild hash. |
| `--no-tests` | Has no effect on which FBOSS targets build: FBOSS's manifest and CMake do not read it. Scope a build with `--cmake-target` instead. |

## What the wrapper does that getdeps does not

1. **Translates SAI flags into environment variables** that CMake reads
   (`SAI_BRCM_IMPL=1`, `SAI_SDK_VERSION=...`, `SAI_VERSION=...`,
   `BUILD_SAI_FAKE=1`, and the NPU SDK version pair). CMake reads these from
   the environment, not only from `-D`.
2. **Stages the vendor SDK** into the layout CMake searches. See
   [supplying-your-sdk.md](supplying-your-sdk.md).
3. **Pins the SAI spec version** by rewriting
   `build/fbcode_builder/manifests/libsai` in place with the matching URL and
   checksum.
4. **Forces the toolchain to Clang** via `update-alternatives`, and
   synthesises the compiler flags by reading the Clang block out of the repo's
   `CMakeLists.txt`. This requires root and effectively only works inside the
   build container.
5. **Runs up to two build passes** into the same tree so one command can link
   the agent against an NPU SDK and `qsfp_targets` against a PHY SDK.
6. **Pre-seeds the download directory** from alternate GNU mirrors, because
   getdeps pins exactly one URL per manifest and mirror rotation can 404 it.

## The pass model

| Flags given | Passes |
|---|---|
| neither | 1: fake SAI (`BUILD_SAI_FAKE=1`) |
| NPU only | 1: NPU |
| PHY only, no `--cmake-target qsfp_targets` | 2: full fake-SAI base, then PHY over `qsfp_targets` |
| PHY only, **with** `--cmake-target qsfp_targets` | 1: PHY only |
| NPU + PHY | 2: NPU base, then PHY over `qsfp_targets` |

Both passes write into the same build tree, and the later one overwrites the
earlier one's `qsfp` artifacts. That is the mechanism, not a bug: a single
CMake configure can hold only one SAI implementation.

Two consequences:

- If you only want qsfp against PAI, pass `--cmake-target qsfp_targets`
  explicitly. Otherwise you pay for a full fake-SAI build first, roughly
  doubling the work.
- In NPU+PHY mode, pass 2 replaces whatever `--cmake-target` you asked for
  with `qsfp_targets`. Your final qsfp binaries are always the PAI-linked
  ones.

Between passes the wrapper resets the SAI environment variables and restores
the `libsai` manifest, so one pass's choices cannot leak into the next.

## Things it does to your checkout

- Rewrites `build/fbcode_builder/manifests/libsai`, and does **not** restore it
  after the final pass.
- Comments out `binutils` in every manifest that lists it, when Clang is used.
  Permanent.
- Neither is reverted. Restore only the files it touched (`git checkout
  build/fbcode_builder/manifests/libsai`, or re-extract the stable-commits
  snapshot); a checkout of the whole `manifests/` directory also discards
  your own edits and the stable pins, and the next build rebuilds everything.

## Non-obvious behaviours

- **Run it from the repository root.** Its Clang setup reads `./CMakeLists.txt`
  from the current directory; from anywhere else it prints
  `Warning: CMakeLists.txt not found, skipping clang-specific flags` and then
  sets *no* compiler flags at all.
- **An unsupported `--npu-sai-impl` value is not rejected.** It is turned into
  an environment variable verbatim, CMake ignores it, and you get a build with
  no SAI implementation selected. Only an advisory note tells you. See
  [supplying-your-sdk.md](supplying-your-sdk.md#new-vendors).
- **An unregistered `--npu-sai-sdk-version` builds**, but the SDK version
  metadata is recorded as `unknown`.
- **Non-`build` subcommands still go through the pass machinery**, so a
  `list-deps` in PHY mode gets `--cmake-target qsfp_targets` injected. Use the
  raw `getdeps.py` for graph queries such as `list-deps`, but not for
  anything involving hashed dependency paths; see
  [getdeps-concepts.md](getdeps-concepts.md#useful-subcommands).
- **Scratch-path detection is a literal scan** of the forwarded arguments with
  a hard-coded fallback. Unusual quoting makes it miss the value and stage SDK
  tarballs into the wrong directory. Pass `--scratch-path` plainly.
