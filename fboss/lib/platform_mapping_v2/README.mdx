# FBOSS Platform Mapping Config Generation (External)

## Overview
We provide a Python helper script to help external FBOSS users generate platform mapping configs (in JSON format) from a folder of CSV source files. These platform mappings are used to configure and run FBOSS software.

## Prerequisites

Python 3 is required in order to run the helper script. You can install it via one of the below commands depending on which Linux distribution you're on.

### Debian

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt install python3
```

### CentOS

```shell
sudo dnf upgrade -y
sudo dnf install python3
```

## Instructions
Platform mapping config generation is done via running the helper script, `run-helper.sh`, as seen below. The helper script needs to be run from the root of the FBOSS repository.

```shell
$ ./fboss/lib/platform_mapping_v2/run-helper.sh --input-dir XXX --output-dir XXX --platform-name XXX
```

Below are the command line arguments that are relevant to this script.

| Argument                    | Description                                          |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| --input-dir (required) | Full directory path that has all vendor source files. |
| --platform-name (required)  | Platform name that each CSV file has as prefix (e.g. wedge400 in wedge400_static_mapping.csv).   |
| --output-dir  | Directory to write platform mapping config (default: /tmp/generated_platform_mappings).   |
| --is-multi-npu  | Generates multi-NPU platform mapping config (default: False).   |


To use this command, you need to provide a folder path via `--input-dir` that includes the following files, with `PLATFORM` being a common string that identifies your platform:
- `PLATFORM_port_profile_mapping.csv`
- `PLATFORM_profile_settings.csv`
- `PLATFORM_si_settings.csv`
- `PLATFORM_static_mapping.csv`
- `PLATFORM_vendor_config.json`

Please take a look at one of our open-sourced platform mapping source files to get an example of what each file should look like (e.g. `platform_mapping_v2/montblanc`).

This command will generate the platform mapping config from these source files and save it to your specified output directory or the default location. To enable proper `qsfp_service` and `agent` initialization, you must manually copy the generated JSON file into the C++ file `fboss/agent/platforms/common/PLATFORM_NAME/PLATFORM_NAME.cpp`.
