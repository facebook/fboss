This Python3 script is to remediate the FBOSS 100G links where the optics has
gone into some bad state. Symptoms: (1) The port is having 200G CMIS optics
configured in 100G mode (2) The optics state machine is in DATAPATH_INITIALIZED
state. This script identifies all such bad ports on a given list of swicthes
and remediates them by re-applying the optics Stage set 0 config once again
