# pyre-strict

"""Runs the pre-flight pipeline against every canonical per-platform
`spec.json` under `fboss/platform/firmware_onboarding/configs/<platform>/`.
Catches regressions where a schema or validator change breaks an existing
onboarded spec.

When a new platform is onboarded, the `firmware-npi-onboard` skill's
**Platform sub-skill** (Phase 5, Step 6) automatically registers the new
platform here as a separate draft diff:

1. Adds an entry to `_CANONICAL_PLATFORMS` below.
2. Adds a corresponding entry to the `resources` dict in
   `//fboss/platform/firmware_onboarding/validator:test_canonical_examples`.

If you are manually adding a new platform without going through the
orchestrator, perform the two steps above by hand.
