 * subclasses.  All nodes should generally implement clone() APIs as well,

   * Vlan, a new Vlan made will be created via the copy-on-write process.
   * However, all nodes referring to VLAN 5 will continue to have NodeID 12.
   *
   * The main purpose for the NodeID field is so that HwSwitch implementations
   * can have a consistent way of referring to a node.  This allows the
   * HwSwitch to store maps from NodeID to their own internal state.  The exact
   * node object (and the pointer to it) may change as the SwitchState is
   * modified, but the NodeID will always remain the same.

 * NodeBaseT is a helper class for implementing nodes in the SwitchState tree.
 *
 * To use NodeBaseT, nodes must define a structure containing all of their copy
 * on write fields.  This structure is supplied as the second template
 * parameter.  The first template parameter is the subclass itself implementing
 * the node.
 *
 * NodeBaseT implements clone(), enforces the published state, and updates the
 * generation number correctly.
 *
 * NodeBaseT implements clone() by relying on the field structure's copy
 * constructor.  If the field structure contains other constructors that also
 * accept a "const FieldsT&" first argument with additional arguments, clone()
 * methods will also be provided with the same arguments.
 *
 * NodeBaseT enforces the published state by ensuring that any modifications to
 * the fields must occur via the writableFields() method.  writableFields() is
 * the only API for getting a writable pointer of the fields, and it ensures
 * that it can only be called on unpublished nodes.a
 *
 * Fields structures must provided a forEachChild() template method, which
 * calls the specified function on child node stored in the fields.  This is
 * used to implement publish().
 *
 * For an example of how to use NodeBaseT, see Vlan.h or Port.h.
