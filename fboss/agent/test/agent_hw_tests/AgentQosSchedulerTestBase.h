   * QoS policies kick in only if there is congestion. Thus, in order to see
   * the effects of WRR/WRR weights/SP, we must inject enough traffic to cause
   * congestion. It turns out that injecting single packet of one dscp type
   * from each queue is not sufficient. Thus, we inject multiple packets.
   *
   * For different values of cnt (number pf UDP packets sent), here is a list
   * of packet rate (in Gbps) observed across different queues. Values are
   * approximate, but the values did not vary too much across multiple runs.
   *
   *     +---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
   *     |   cnt   |  queue0  |  queue1  |  queue2  |  queue4  |
   *     +---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
   *     |   1     |   0.8    |   0.8    |   0.8    |   0.8    |
   *     |   10    |   3.6    |   3.6    |   2.7    |   1.7    |
   *     |   20    |   3.3    |   5.8    |   1.8    |   1.1    |
   *     |   30    |   2.5    |   7.2    |   1.3    |   0.8    |
   *     |   50    |   1.6    |   8.9    |   0.9    |   0.5    |
   *     +---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
   *
   * Observations:
   *  o For single packet, there is no congestion - sum of packet rate <
   *    line rate (10Gbps). As the number of packets per flow increases
   *    we start observing congestion (cnt = 10, 20, .. etc.).
   *  o WRR weights are honored when there is congestion.
   *  o At cnt = 10, there isn't enough traffic to cause congestion all the
   *    time. Thus, queue0 and queue1, with weights 15 and 80 respectively,
   *    have same packet rate, but that is more than queue2 and queue4 whose
   *    weights are 8 and 5 respectively.
   *  o As the number of packets per flow go up (cnt = 20, 30, 50), congestion
   *    becomes more likely, and thus the WRR weights are honored closer to the
   *    ration of weights.
   *  o At cnt = 50, there seems to be enough traffic for each flow to cause
   *    conestion all the time, and thus packet rate ration across any pair of
   *    queues matches their weight ratio.
   *
   *  cnt = 50 seems sufficient to check WRR weight ratio. To try to avoid the
   *  risk of test being flaky, we choose 2 * 50 number of packets for the
   *  test.
