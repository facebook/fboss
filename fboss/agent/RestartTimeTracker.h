/**
 * This module exports restart timing info. The main interface is the
 * mark() method, which can be called from any point in our code to
 * track when an event occurs. The trickiest part of this is that the
 * tracking actually occurs across process invocations, so we save
 * some timestamps during the shutdown path.
 *
 * NOTE: the implementation here is NOT very portable and relies on
 * the behavior of std::chrono::steady_clock using boot time as the
 * epoch. Nothing in the standard guarantees this, but most
 * implementations use boot time as the epoch in order to guarantee
 * monotonicity. An implementation that uses process_time as epoch is
 * also possible, which would break the duration calculation in this
 * module.
