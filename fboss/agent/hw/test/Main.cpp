/*
 * The filename provided to logger uses the string "fboss/agent/.cpp".
 * LoggerDB recursively finds the parent by stripping the filename using
 * the separator and finally ends with "fboss" in the string and the
 * corresponding LogLevel is picked to print the log.
 *
 * In OSS, the file name provided to logger uses the string
 * "/var/FBOSS/tmp_build_dir/fboss-git/fboss/agent*.cpp". When LoggerDB
 * recursively finds the parent by stripping the filename using the separator,
 * it never finds "fboss" string in its DB and ends up setting the default
 * logging level which is INFO.
 *
 * The stripping is different internally and in OSS because when buck2 is used
 * to build, there is an additional processing done to the filenames which
 * removes few strings from the beginning of the path.
 *
 * To fix this issue, we are adding a flag for OSS builds to set the logging
 * without the category.
