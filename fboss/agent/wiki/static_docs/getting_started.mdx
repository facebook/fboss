# Getting started with FBOSS

This wiki provides quick list of commands/tips for someone new to FBOSS
development (e.g. a bootcamper).

# Reserving a switch

We use the netcastle tool to reserve a switch for development. You can reserve a
switch by going to the
[netcastle UI](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/network/netcastle/).

## FBOSS stack

Devices in the fboss.autotest pool are reserved for on diff testing. You can
still reserve a device here but it might slow down the diff testing process.

Most of the lab devices do not have the "fboss stack." This means that all the
30 services and daemons that are expected in our fleet are not running. This
type of device just has linux installed and can be used to test a change to a
single binary. We can test changes really quickly on a device like this. These
devices also have no connections to other devices.

For fboss2 CLI changes, we need to find a device that is running the fboss
stack.

You can also distinguish these device types by the device attribute,
"running_fboss_stack."

# Devserver vs on demand

Dev servers are the preferred way for development because they have much more
resources to support the large builds that we have. You can reserve a dev server
[here](https://www.internalfb.com/devservers/)

# Building fboss2 changes

```
buck2 build fbcode//fboss/cli/fboss2:fboss2 --show-output
```

# Testing fboss2 cli changes
You can use the binary that was generated from the previous build command like this. You do not need to ship the binary and then test it on the box.

```

./buck-out/v2/gen/fbcode/f5ebbc4543b308cd/fboss/cli/fboss2/__fboss2__/fboss2 -H $switch show route details

```

# Checking out fboss code

```
fbclone fbcode
cd ~/fbsource/fbcode/fboss/
```

# Building and deploying a the fboss_sw_agent

```
fboss-dev-helper --notify dev fboss_sw_agent $testSwitch
```
# Building and deploying hw wedge_agent
## Find out the sdk version supported by the ASIC

This file shows us which SDK is supported on each ASIC: fbcode/fboss/build/sdk.bzl

```
fboss-dev-helper --notify dev fboss_hw_agent-brcm-10.2.0.0_odp $testSwitch
```
