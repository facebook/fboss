 * Shell tab-completion for a partially typed fboss2 command line.
 *
 * `words` is every word after the program name, the last one being the
 * (possibly empty) word under the cursor. The initialized CLI11 tree is
 * walked along the leading words: a word naming a sub-command descends, a
 * word starting with '-' is an option (its value is skipped when it takes
 * one), and anything else is a positional argument of the current command.
 *
 * Returns the tokens that may complete the last word:
 * - options (long and short names) when the last word starts with '-';
 * - otherwise the sub-commands of the current command, plus whatever the
 *   command's positional-argument completer (see utils/ArgCompletion.h)
 *   offers given the positionals typed so far.
 *
 * No prefix filtering is done here; the shell does that.
