  // changing a sibling object's meaning when the VLAN is still in use. Each
  // referrer must be cleared first:
  //   - it is the global default VLAN (SwitchConfig.defaultVlan)
  //       -> point the default elsewhere: config vlan default <other-id>

  //     only fallback value is 0, which means routed port, so clearing it here
  //     would change the port's L2 mode
  //       -> move the port: config interface <port> switchport access vlan
  //          <other-id>
  // Throws FbossError if no VLAN with the given ID exists.
