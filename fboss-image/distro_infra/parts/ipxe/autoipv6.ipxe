# When booting over IPv6, iPXE only receives a fully-formed bootfile-url DHCPv6 option and it appears there is no way to
# give just iPXE other options. bootfile-url becomes the iPXE ${filename} setting, but is a full URL and iPXE scripting
# is not powerful enough to extract just the server IP from it so we can use HTTP downloading for the large artifacts.
# Thus we autogenerate this iPXE script simply to set the server IP to be used by autoexec.ipxe.
