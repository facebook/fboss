"""The one file that says what a distro image was assembled from.

An image is assembled from components built elsewhere. Each already states
something about itself, so this collects those statements and writes a single
record, letting an image be identified and rebuilt.

Reading and writing are separated. A schema per manifest component declares what
to read from that component and which version each reading provides; one writer
turns whatever was collected into the record. Supporting a new component, or a
new version from an existing one, is a schema entry -- no reader, and no part of
the writer, has to change.

Every component is described the same way:

    source       what the manifest asked for, and any claim its artifact
                 contradicts
    artifact     the staged name and its checksum
    provenance   what the artifact reports about itself, verbatim

A component that can report nothing carries no provenance, which is where a gap
shows -- on the component itself, not in a list apart from it.
