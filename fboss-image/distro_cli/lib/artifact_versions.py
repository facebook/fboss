"""Readers for the version evidence a component artifact carries.

Each reader pulls one kind of evidence out of an artifact and knows nothing
about which component it came from or where the result is written. The
per-module schema decides which readers apply, so supporting a new component is
a schema entry rather than a change here.

Every reader is best effort. A host without rpm or modinfo, an artifact that is
not the archive expected, or metadata that will not parse costs that one reader
its result and nothing else.
