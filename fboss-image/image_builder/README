This directory contains files necessary to generate bootable images for FBOSS using the kiwi ng tool.

KIWI NG Documentation:
    https://osinside.github.io/kiwi/overview.html

KIWI NG XML Schema:
    https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi.git

    Steps to validate schema changes:
        1) Clone the above repository
        2) xmllint --relaxng  kiwi/kiwi/schema/kiwi.rng <templates/centos-09.0/config.xml>

The directories here are:

    bin         - executable scripts that do the real work
    lib         - helper code that is common across scripts
    logs        - all logs go here
    templates   - kiwi-ng image templates
    output      - all build output goes here

image_builder/bin:
    build_image.sh                  - Build docker (if needed) and launch build_image_in_container.sh
    build_image_in_container.sh     - Script that builds the image inside docker container

image_builder/templates:
    Contains the template(s) that contain the information needed by kiwi-ng-3
    to generate
        centos-09.0     - CentOS-9.0 based FBOSS image template files

image_builder/output:
    All generated output goes into this directory

To build a bootable image the steps are as follows (all scripts support -h or --help option)

    Build and launch the docker:
        git clone https://github.com/facebook/fboss <wsdir>
        <wsdir>/fboss-image/image_builder/bin/build_image.sh -b          # Launch image build inside docker

    This will generate the many files in /image_builder/output, the main being:
        FBOSS-Distro-Image.x86_64-1.0.install.tar
        FBOSS-Distro-Image.x86_64-1.0.install.iso
